## Locmoss Methods

### `get_extra_info`

- **Description:** This method retrieves additional information about the Locmoss process. Currently, it returns an empty string as a placeholder for future implementation.
- **Arguments:** None
- **Returns:** `str` - An empty string.

### `get_similarity_coefficient`

- **Description:** This method calculates the similarity coefficient between two pieces of code using the Locmoss algorithm. The Locmoss algorithm is designed to detect similarities between code snippets, even if they have been obfuscated. It utilizes the winnowing algorithm for efficient similarity detection.
- **Arguments:**
  - `processed_code1 (str)`: The first piece of processed code.
  - `processed_code2 (str)`: The second piece of processed code.
- **Returns:** `float` - The similarity coefficient between the two pieces of code.

### Algorithm Used: Winnowing

- **Description:** Winnowing is a local fingerprinting algorithm used to select a subset of hashed values from a document to represent it. This subset is used to efficiently compare documents for similarity.
