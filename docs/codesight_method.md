## Codesight Methods

### `analyze_code`

- **Description:** This method analyzes a piece of code and generates a signature for it. Codesight is a tool that tokenizes the source code and generates a unique signature for each file, which can be used for comparison. It uses the Greedy String Tiling algorithm for tokenization.
- **Arguments:**
  - `code (str)`: The code to be analyzed.
- **Returns:** `Signature` - The generated signature for the code.

### `compare_signatures`

- **Description:** This method compares two signatures generated by the Codesight tool to determine the similarity between the corresponding pieces of code.
- **Arguments:**
  - `signature1 (Signature)`: The first signature.
  - `signature2 (Signature)`: The second signature.
- **Returns:** `float` - The similarity score between the two signatures.

### Algorithm Used: Greedy String Tiling

- **Description:** Greedy String Tiling is an algorithm used to find the longest matching substrings between two strings. It is particularly useful for detecting plagiarism and code similarity by identifying common sequences of tokens.
